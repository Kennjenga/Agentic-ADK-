# Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) Summary

## What is Agent Development Kit?

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible, modular framework for building and deploying AI agents. Developed by Google, ADK is optimized for the Gemini ecosystem but remains model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, ensuring compatibility with other frameworks and platforms. Its primary goal is to make agent development as intuitive as traditional software development, enabling developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures for both simple and complex workflows.

## Key Features

### 1. Flexible Orchestration
- **Workflow Agents:** Define predictable pipelines using Sequential, Parallel, and Loop agents.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Use LLM-driven agents (e.g., `LlmAgent transfer`) for adaptive, context-aware behavior.

### 2. Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Modularity:** Compose multiple specialized agents in hierarchical structures.
- **Scalability:** Coordinate and delegate tasks across agents for complex applications.

### 3. Rich Tool Ecosystem
- **Pre-built Tools:** Integrate capabilities like Search and Code Execution.
- **Custom Functions:** Extend agents with your own logic.
- **Third-party Integration:** Connect with libraries such as LangChain and CrewAI, or use other agents as tools.

### 4. Deployment Ready
- **Containerization:** Package agents for deployment anywhere.
- **Scalability:** Run locally, on Vertex AI Agent Engine, or via Cloud Run/Docker for custom infrastructure.

### 5. Built-in Evaluation
- **Performance Assessment:** Evaluate both final outputs and step-by-step execution against test cases.

### 6. Safety and Security
- **Best Practices:** Implement security and safety patterns to build trustworthy agents.
